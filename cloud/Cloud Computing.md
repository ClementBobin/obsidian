## 💡 **What is Cloud Computing?**

> [!info] **Definition**  
> Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics—over the internet ("the cloud") to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

These services fall into three main categories:

- **🧱 Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** — Rent virtual machines, storage, and networks.
    
- **🧰 Platform as a Service (PaaS)** — Use a development and deployment platform without managing infrastructure.
    
- **📦 Software as a Service (SaaS)** — Access software applications over the web.

## 🧬 **Key Characteristics of Cloud Computing**

> [!abstract]+  
> Cloud computing is defined by several essential traits that set it apart from traditional hosting models:

1. **⚡ On-Demand Self-Service** – Provision resources as needed without human intervention.
    
2. **🌐 Broad Network Access** – Access services over the internet on any device.
    
3. **🔗 Resource Pooling** – Providers dynamically assign resources to multiple customers.
    
4. **📈 Rapid Elasticity** – Instantly scale up or down based on demand.
    
5. **📊 Measured Service** – Pay only for what you use, monitored and optimized by the provider.

## 🧩 **Cloud Service Models**

> [!tip] **Choose the right model for your needs**  
> Each cloud model provides a different level of control and abstraction:

|Model|Control|Description|
|---|---|---|
|🧱 **IaaS**|High|Access raw infrastructure like VMs and networks|
|🧰 **PaaS**|Medium|Develop and run apps without managing infrastructure|
|📦 **SaaS**|Low|Use software via the web without worrying about installation or updates|

## 🗂️ **Cloud Deployment Models**

Cloud services can be deployed in various ways to suit different operational and compliance needs:

- **🌍 Public Cloud** – Hosted by third-party vendors and shared among multiple users.
    
- **🏢 Private Cloud** – Used exclusively by a single organization, often for enhanced control.
    
- **🔁 Hybrid Cloud** – Combines public and private clouds for flexibility and workload portability.
    
- **🌐 Multi-Cloud** – Utilizes services from multiple cloud providers to avoid dependency on one.
