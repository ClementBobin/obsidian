# 🛡️ GitGuardian

GitGuardian is a security tool designed to monitor and protect your repositories from leaking sensitive information such as **API keys**, **credentials**, and **secrets**.

---

## 🔍 Overview

- **Purpose**: Detect secrets in your codebase and prevent credential leaks.
- **Integration**: Works with GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and CI/CD pipelines.
- **Target audience**: Developers, DevOps, SecOps.

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- 🔐 **Secrets detection** in source code and git history.
- 📈 **Dashboard** for monitoring incidents.
- 🔄 **CI/CD integration** for automated scanning.
- 🧩 **Public and private repo monitoring**.
- 👥 **Team collaboration** on incidents.
- 🔗 **Integrations** with Slack, Jira, and more.

---

## ⚙️ Setup

### 🔧 Local CLI Tool

```bash
brew install gitguardian/tap/gitguardian
ggshield auth login
ggshield scan path .
````

- `ggshield` is the GitGuardian CLI.
    
- Use it locally or in CI pipelines.
    

### 🤖 CI/CD Integration

Add to your pipeline (example for GitHub Actions):

```yaml
- name: GitGuardian Scan
  uses: GitGuardian/ggshield-action@v1.19.0
  with:
    args: scan repo
  env:
    GITGUARDIAN_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.GITGUARDIAN_API_KEY }}
```

---

## 🛑 Responding to Incidents

1. **Revoke** the exposed key or credential.
    
2. **Remove** the secret from git history (use `git filter-repo` or `BFG Repo-Cleaner`).
    
3. **Push** the clean history.
    
4. **Document** the incident.

## 📊 Dashboard

- Displays:
    
    - Incident list
        
    - Severity and impact
        
    - Time of detection
        
    - Resolution status

## 🔒 Best Practices

- Never commit secrets (use `.env` files).
    
- Use Git pre-commit hooks with `ggshield`.
    
- Rotate credentials regularly.
    
- Set up alerting for your team.

## 🚀 Future Vision

GitGuardian is working toward a **centralized secret management and leak investigation solution** that works across:

- ☁️ **Multi-cloud environments** (AWS, Azure, GCP)
    
- 🐳 **Docker containers**
    
- ☸️ **Kubernetes clusters**
    
- 🔁 **Interconnected systems** (API, microservices, third-party SaaS)
    

Key goals:

- 🧩 Detect **where** the secret leaked from (source tracing).
    
- 📍 Identify **where** the secret is being used (impact analysis).
    
- 🧠 Automate remediation workflows.
    
- 🔐 Secure secrets in real-time and prevent propagation.
    

This marks a shift from reactive detection to **proactive protection** and **context-aware security** in dynamic infrastructures.
