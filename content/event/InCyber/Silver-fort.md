# 🛡️ Silverfort

Silverfort is a **Unified Identity Protection** platform that extends **Zero Trust security** to **any resource**, including those that couldn’t previously be protected with modern identity tools like MFA or conditional access.

---

## 🔍 Overview

- **Product Type**: Unified Identity Protection / Zero Trust Identity Platform
- **Focus**: Extending identity security (MFA, conditional access, risk-based policies) to **all** assets:
  - Legacy systems
  - Command-line tools
  - IT/OT environments
  - On-prem and cloud resources

---

## 🧠 Key Features

### 🔐 Agentless MFA Everywhere
- Adds **Multi-Factor Authentication** to resources that don't natively support it:
  - SSH, RDP, SMB, legacy apps
  - File shares, command-line tools

### 🚪 Conditional Access Policies
- Enforce risk-aware, identity-based policies.
- Block or challenge access based on:
  - User identity
  - Resource type
  - Access context (IP, location, behavior)

### 🔎 Identity Threat Detection & Response (ITDR)
- Monitors authentication traffic to detect:
  - Lateral movement
  - Credential theft
  - Pass-the-hash and Golden Ticket attacks

### 🏭 Legacy & OT Coverage
- Protects systems without agents or modern protocols.
- Works with mainframes, industrial control systems (ICS), and OT devices.

### 🔗 Integrates with:
- Microsoft Active Directory (deep integration)
- Azure AD
- Okta, Ping, CyberArk, and more

## ⚙️ Deployment

- 💡 Agentless (no need to install software on endpoints)
- 🌐 Cloud-native platform
- 🧠 Uses existing authentication protocols like Kerberos and NTLM

---

## 🚨 Use Cases

- 🧱 Applying MFA to legacy, on-prem, and non-web systems
- 🔐 Enforcing Zero Trust identity security across hybrid environments
- 🔍 Detecting identity-based threats
- 🛡️ Securing privileged account access
- 🏭 Extending identity protection to OT/ICS systems

---

## 🖥️ Dashboard & Management

- Unified console to:
  - Create and enforce identity policies
  - Monitor authentication activity
  - Investigate identity threats
  - Audit and alert in real-time

## 🧠 How Silverfort Implements Zero Trust

> “If you can’t see it or protect it—you can’t trust it.”

- Every access request is verified dynamically.
- Identity is the new perimeter, enforced consistently across environments.
- Unifies protection across cloud, on-prem, legacy, and OT systems.
