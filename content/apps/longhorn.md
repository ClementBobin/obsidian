## 🏃 Getting Started

### 📦 Install Longhorn using Helm

> [!tip] Customize [[Helm]] values by reviewing [values.yaml](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/blob/master/chart/values.yaml)

```bash
helm repo add longhorn https://charts.longhorn.io
helm repo update
helm install longhorn longhorn/longhorn
```

---

## 🔧 Customization and Configuration

> [!example]+ [[Helm]] Values Example You can override values like storage class name, default replica count, or node selectors in your custom `values.yaml`.

```yaml
defaultSettings:
  defaultReplicaCount: 3
  defaultDataPath: "/var/lib/longhorn"
```

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

> [!question]- Why is my volume stuck in `detached` state?
> 
> - Check if the node is available and has disk space.
>     
> - Look into the `longhorn-manager` logs for possible issues.
>     
> - Ensure the Longhorn UI shows the node as `Ready`.
>     

> [!warning]  
> Make sure **default Kubernetes storage class** is not conflicting with Longhorn if you're using multiple storage providers.
