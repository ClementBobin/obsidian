## 🔧 Basic Usage

### Start an Application

```sh
pm2 start app.js
```

This starts the `app.js` file as a PM2-managed process.

### List Running Processes

```sh
pm2 list
```

Shows a table with information about all managed processes.

### Restart a Process

```sh
pm2 restart app
```

Restarts the process named `app`.

### Stop and Delete a Process

```sh
pm2 stop app
pm2 delete app
```

Stops and removes the process from PM2.

### Auto Restart on System Boot

> [!tip]  
> To ensure PM2 restarts applications when the system reboots, run:

```sh
pm2 startup
```

Then follow the instructions to enable the startup script.

### Logs

To view logs in real-time:

```sh
pm2 logs
```

To filter logs for a specific process:

```sh
pm2 logs app
```

### Process Scaling

To start multiple instances of an application:

```sh
pm2 start app.js -i max
```

To specify the number of instances:

```sh
pm2 start app.js -i 4
```

### Monitoring

For real-time monitoring:

```sh
pm2 monit
```
