## 🔧 Configuration

### 👥 Users and Roles

> [!tip]  
> To manage users and roles in Teleport, refer to the [Role Templates](https://goteleport.com/docs/access-controls/guides/role-templates/) guide.

- **Creating Roles**: Define roles for users to specify the resources they can access and the permissions they have.
    
- **Assigning Roles**: Assign users to specific roles to manage access based on the principle of least privilege.

### TCTL

To manage nodes and other resources via the command line, Teleport uses `tctl`:

#### 🖥️ Adding Nodes

To add a new node with specific roles, run:

```sh
tctl nodes add --roles=<node,app,kube,proxy,...> --ttl=1h
```

This will add a new node to your Teleport environment with the specified roles.
